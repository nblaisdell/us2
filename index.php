            <h3>Steam Expertise</h3>
            <p>US2 provides retrofit installation of energy conservation measures including steam trap monitoring systems, HVAC installations and renovations, cost efficient hot water systems, and steam/condensate metering.</p>
            <h3>Customer Challenges</h3>
            <p>Many utility systems currently in use were constructed in an era characterized by values very different from the ones now prevalent. Energy efficiency was not a priority. Consequently, multiple Federal facilities and some private sector facilities are saddled with large, aging steam and hot water systems which under-perform and demand ongoing repairs. Within these structures, with increasing regularity, deficiencies in the existing steam and hot water systems have been costly.</p>
            <h3>Steam Monitoring Services We Offer</h3>
            <p>Our primary area of expertise is the installation of steam trap wireless monitoring systems using a Web-based information collection network. These intelligent systems enable clients to save on energy production costs and maintenance labor. To accomplish this, US2 offers turnkey projects from energy surveys to retrofit installation of energy-saving equipment, with provision for the ongoing measuring of energy utilization. New technologies, including acoustic steam trap sensors and wireless web-enabled receivers make it possible to retrofit older systems cost-effectively and achieve significant performance improvement and measurable energy savings.</p>
            <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
            <p>US2 primarily serves Federal agencies mandated to achieve energy savings, particularly VA hospitals and defense installations. We also support other Federal facilities, and some private sector facilities that desire to Eco-fit their systems to make them ecological and economical for the future.</p>
